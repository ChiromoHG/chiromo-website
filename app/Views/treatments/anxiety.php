                        Anxiety is a common and natural response to stress or perceived threats, but when it becomes 
                        excessive or overwhelming, it can interfere with daily life and well-being. From generalized 
                        anxiety disorder to social anxiety and panic attacks, anxiety can manifest in various forms, 
                        each with its own set of symptoms and challenges. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore 
                        different types of anxiety, their symptoms, potential causes, available treatments, and strategies
                         for coping with anxiety.
